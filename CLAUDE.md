# NGX Voice Sales Agent - Development Guide

## Project Overview

NGX Voice Sales Agent is a specialized conversational AI sales agent designed to sell NGX services and programs. This intelligent agent deeply understands NGX's audience, services, pricing tiers, and uses ML adaptive learning to continuously improve conversion rates. The system provides a single, highly optimized sales agent (not a multi-agent system) that can be integrated across multiple touchpoints.
